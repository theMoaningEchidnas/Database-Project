PLAN for splitting the tasks:
	Together create the DB backbone 
	Decide what controllers/ views will be available and split them 
		Everyone first writes the VIEW on paper showing controls => we approve => he starts coding
		When someone is ready with view => we test it in details => he fixes bugs
		He decides on UT => we approve => he writes test
	REFACTORING - everyone refactor his own work and review others with suggestions for code change, if any
